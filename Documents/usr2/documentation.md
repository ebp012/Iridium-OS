# BestPenguin Disk User Guide
Bestpenguin Disk is a high-level OS constructed out of `pure` C++. In order to use it, you must:
* Fork the repl
* Enter your name
* Enter an app name
* and then enjoy as much as you like! No BS guaranteed!

Note: You may consider downloading it right to your machine if you do not want your files visible to the public. Or, just get the Repl.it hacker plan and make your fork `private`.
